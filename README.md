**⚠️ Development paused**

This was my first attempt at building a 2D survival game with vanilla JavaScript.  
Although it's not polished and contains many bugs, I learned a lot in the process.

I'll revisit and rebuild this project in the future.  
For now — `to be continued...` 🚧

## 💡 Lessons learned

- DOM and canvas-based game logic
- Asset management and enemy spawning
- Game loops, timers, animations

Stay tuned. The swamp will rise again. 🌫️
